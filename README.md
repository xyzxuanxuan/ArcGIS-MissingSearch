# ArcGIS-MissingSearch

This is a project that I did three years ago.

This is an ArcMap Add-in. The tool is used for searching the missing values of a field and give suggestion values based on the value of the closest features.
(This is based on the first law of geography:everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things).

I haven't updated the code since three years ago, please contace me if the code has bugs. :-p
